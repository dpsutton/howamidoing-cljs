## Clone of enjoyingthe.show in CLJS

This is a clone of [enjoyingthe.show](enjoyingthe.show) from Gant Laborde [github](https://github.com/GantMan/howamidoing).

## To run

You'll need

- node
- java

Then run `npx shadow-cljs watch app` and go to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) to see the app.

It relies on shadow-cljs to provide the amazing interop with npm and Gant Laborde's clever app. It is a perfect foray into new territory while remaining understandable, small in scope, and visually rewarding. Thanks very much to Gant for making the original and sharing it.
